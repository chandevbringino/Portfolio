### This is my portfolio, showcasing my expertise in iOS and Android.

So far, this repo has three iOS Applications. But more will be made with other platforms soon. 😊🤞<br>
I will indicate what's available for now below:

# iOS
## Apps with Swift & Storyboard
1. [EmployeeApp](https://github.com/chandevbringino/Portfolio/tree/main/iOS/Swift/EmployeeApp)

## Apps with SwiftUI
1. [WeSplit](https://github.com/chandevbringino/Portfolio/tree/main/iOS/SwiftUI/WeSplit)
2. [GuessTheFlag](https://github.com/chandevbringino/Portfolio/tree/main/iOS/SwiftUI/GuessTheFlag)

‼️ NOTE ‼️<br>
FYI: In this repository, I am only demonstrating the apps I made, the architecture, structure, and pattern I used with no regards to git branching. You may see that I don't branchout from my main when adding a feature, fixing a bug or keep the commits message very good. But I am aware of how to do git branching. Thank you. 😊
