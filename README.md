This is my portfolio, showcasing my expertise in iOS and Android.

‼️ NOTE ‼️

In this repository, I am only demonstrating the apps I made, the architecture, structure, and pattern with no regards to git branching. You may see that I don't branchout from my main when adding a feature, fixing a bug or keep the commits message very good. But I am aware of how to do git branching. Thank you. 😊
